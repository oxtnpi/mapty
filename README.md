# mapty
This is an educational project created by Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!"

In this project, the Leaflet library was used and OOP principles were applied.

In this project, you can record your activities by placing them on a map. To create an activity, you need to mark the place where it took place on the map and enter the data in the appearing field, where you can also select the type of activity. All data is saved in local storage.
